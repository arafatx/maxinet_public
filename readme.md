This is a personal project that I wrote for server automation to reduce server configuration time. 
The aim is this project is to have everything automated when deploying a new server without wasting a lot of time. 
For example setting up a secured server with hardened configs might take few weeks (I've experienced this) but this script will reduce that longer period to about 1 hour with one command! 
I focused a lot of security enhancements in this script for a new server deployment in order to reduce server malicious attack.

# Warning, you should not use this script if you don't know the purpose of this script. This script might contain bug (especially this public version)
There is another private version without ```_public``` name URL that always have the latest code and features.

Running example:

````
maxinet create-server --rebuild-all --backup
````

The feature is currently huge to list out.

It might contain bugs for other distributions. This script is fully tested on Debian 10, Debian 11 and with Directadmin custom and auto installation
