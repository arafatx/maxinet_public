    <h1>Sofibox Firewall Information</h1>

    <p>Warning: For security reason, your IP has been blacklisted by our firewall due to repeated authorization failures.</p>
    <h3> Solutions: </h3>
    <p>1) Normally this is a temporary block and our firewall will unblock your IP  within 1 hour.</p>
    <p>2) If you think this is a mistake and need to have your IP whitelisted immediately, please email us at info@sofibox.com</p>
    <p>3) If you are using a dynamic IP, another way your could try is to restart your main ISP router to get a new IP address </p>
    <p>4) If you are using a static IP please contact us info@sofibox.com </p>
