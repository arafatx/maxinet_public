# Fill appropriate variable before running setup. Make sure this file is in the same path with the script.
# This file contains sensitive information, setup will auto destroy this file after finished installation.
# So make sure you have the original backup / copy of your modified maxisetup.conf file
# Default name should be maxisetup.conf. If you want to change this, modify the variable CONFIG_FILE="yourfileenv"
# Remember password cannot contain # ! ' / \ $ & because u need to escape this if u want to use in bash.
# Do not use this character in mysql or mariadb password: < > because mysqltuner does not support this character
